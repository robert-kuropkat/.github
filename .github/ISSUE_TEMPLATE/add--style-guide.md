# Color Theory & Palette

* Primary, secondary, and tertiary palettes
* Faction or biome-specific colors
* Lighting and shadow color rules
* Contrast rules for accessibility

# Shape Language

* Silhouette principles (e.g., blocky = strong, angular = dangerous, rounded = friendly)
* Style-unifying geometry (e.g., 2:1 proportions, soft corners, perspective exaggeration)

# Line Quality & Rendering Rules

* Line thickness, tapering, outline usage
* Shading style (flat, painterly, PBR, cel-shaded)
* Texture rules (amount of noise, brush strokes, detail complexity)
