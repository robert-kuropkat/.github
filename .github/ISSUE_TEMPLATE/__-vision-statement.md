_This is highly flexible document with no standard form.  In general, it should include some sort of statements aligning with Intent, Timeline and Purpose.  These should then naturally support follow-on market and product analysis as well as easily transform into the driving Mission Statement._

# Intent

_Short statement that will align with the mission goal.  This can and should include secondary goals, that are not directly related to the game itself if there are any_

# Timeline

_Can be stated in indeterminant boundaries such as phases, milestones, etc._

# Purpose

_Short supporting reason for why these goals and timelines are being chosen.  This has no directly descending documents.  Instead, it is used as an additional guide star when later determining features, tasks, etc._
