# Core Loop

_The Core Game Loop is the moment-to-moment cycle of actions the player repeats continuously during active gameplay. This is what players do every few seconds._

# Meta Loop

_The Meta Game Loop is the long-term progression structure that sits above the core loop.
This is what players do over sessions to stay motivated. e.g. level progression, achievements, etc._

# Feedback Loops

_A Feedback Loop is the system of consequences that react to the player’s performance and influence future performance.  These can be both positive and negative feedback_
